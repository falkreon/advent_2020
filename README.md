# Advent of Code 2020 Work

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. You can check it out over at https://adventofcode.com/2020/


THIS codebase is *my* solutions for this year's Advent of Code problems, at least until I get bored and stop doing them. It's my hope that in comparing our work we can all get better at what we do, and situations like this can happen a little less: https://xkcd.com/2030/


Plus I just, haven't written any code in a little while and I can't stand not doing that.
